# Easy Difficulty - Nmap Firewall/IDS/IPS Evasion Lab

In this lab, I was tasked by the client to identify which operating system their provided machine is running on. Submitting the OS name as the answer.  

## Getting Started

To access the provided machine, I first needed to connect to the company's network via VPN. I downloaded the connection file supplied by Hack The Box and established the connection using the openvpn tool in my terminal.

Next, I pinged the host to check if it was responsive, confirming that I was successfully connected to the network.

We are now ready to perform the first scan. With no prior information about the target, we will begin with a full, non-intrusive scan to identify open ports for further investigation.

- From the results, we can see that three ports are open: 22, 80, and 10001. However, we will focus only on ports 22 and 80, as they are well-recognized and commonly used. Scanning for service information on port 10001 would unnecessarily increase the number of intrusion alerts.

We will refer to this .php webpage, which displays the number of recorded alerts generated by our actions. So far, after pinging the host and performing the initial scan, we have triggered only 13 out of 100 alerts before being blocked by the network's IPS.
