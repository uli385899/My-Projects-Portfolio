# Home Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Lab

This project involves setting up a home SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) lab on my Kali Linux machine, designed to monitor and analyze system activity by forwarding all logs and events to the Elastic Cloud server. The goal of this lab is to provide real-time security monitoring, log aggregation, and threat detection in my local environment.
