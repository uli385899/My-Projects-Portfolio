# Greetings, I'm Uli ðŸ‘½
Pronouns: He/Him

I am a recent IT Support bootcamp graduate that is ready to transition into the IT and cybersecurity field. I grew a profound interest in technology and digital security ever since I've been a victim of personal cyber attacks.

# Objective
My self-learning path in cybersecurity has led me to develop a passion to become a penetration tester, but for now, I am aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst or any entry level role.

# What I'm currently working on
I'm currently enrolled in the SOC Analyst Job Role Patch on Hack The Box Academy. This academy path is designed to equip me with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in security operations. The curriculum focuses on core concepts such as security monitoring, traffic analysis, SIEM tools, and detecting attack tactics and methodologies used by adversaries

  &nbsp;
 
  This project demonstrates the creation of a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) home lab using my Kali Linux virtual machine and Elastic Cloud platform. The lab is designed to parse and monitor security-related logs and events from my local host (Kali Linux machine) and send the data to the Elastic Cloud server for centralized analysis, visualization, and alerting.

  ## Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) for VPN utilization on unsupported devices
  
  As a competitive *Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege* player on console, I would experience recurring DDoS attacks. Opposing players would use third-party websites to resolve gamertags to IP addresses, such as Octosniffer and XResolver, using that information to *boot* players offline using DDoS panels.

  Due to Xbox's lack of first-party VPN support, I encountered an ongoing infrastructure problem. To safeguard myself, I forwarded a VPN service to my gaming console via Ethernet, utilizing Windows built-in Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) feature on my desktop.

  As you can see, the VPN server has successfully been bridged to my gaming console as I'm connected to a server in the European region.

  <summary>Incident Handler's Journal</summary>
  
  ## Incident Handler's Journal
  Throughout my cybersecurity course, I utilized the incident handler's journal, a vital tool for tracking and managing security incidents. This journal provides a detailed record of each incident, including the date, description, tools used, timelines, and additional notes. It serves as a reference for past experiences, helping to improve future responses and ensuring comprehensive documentation for compliance and analysis.

  ## Applying filters to SQL queries
  In this project, I was tasked with analyzing and reporting on suspicious activities detected by the organization's monitoring system that occurred outside of regular business hours. The process involved applying various SQL filters to retrieve and examine relevant data, allowing for more efficient identification of potential security incidents.
  
  For a detailed walkthrough of the project, including the SQL queries used and the results obtained, please refer to the PDF linked below:

  ## Risk Register
  A risk register is an essential tool for identifying, assessing, and managing potential risks that could adversely affect an organization or project. It acts as a centralized repository, providing a structured     approach to risk management by documenting all identified risks.
  
  For this project, I developed a risk register for a fictional bank situated in a coastal region, focusing on compliance and regulatory requirements set by the Federal Reserve. The assessment highlights key risks   related to the bankâ€™s operations and ensures adherence to these critical regulatory standards.
  
  For the risk register document, please refer to the PDF file linked below:

  ## Creating an algorithm in Python for updating files
  Automation involves using algorithms to perform complex tasks quickly and efficiently, oftenly done in seconds. This allows us to increase performance and productiviy, which are staples for a successful business.
  
  In this project, I was assigned to create an algorithm that takes two inputs: a file containing allowed IP addresses and a list of restricted IP addresses. It reads the allowed IPs from the file, converts them into a list, and iterates through this list to remove any IPs that are also on the restricted list. Finally, it updates the original file with the revised list of allowed IP addresses. The main purpose of this algorithm is to efficiently manage and update IP address lists within a network by automatically removing restricted IPs. This helps maintain the security and integrity of the network by ensuring that only allowed IPs are present in the updated file, streamlining the process of IP management.

  <summary>Alert Ticket</summary>

  ## Alert Ticket
  In this exercise, I was handed an alert ticket to solve a security incident involving a medium-severity phishing attempt. The alert ticket, which serves as a documented report of detected security threats, detailed a suspicious email received by the HR department. The email contained an attachment named bfsvc.exe, identified as malicious software capable of granting backdoor access to the system. Due to the associated risks, the incident was escalated for further action.

  Please refer to the pdf file below for a detailed look on the alert ticket:
