# Greetings earthling, Im Uli ðŸ‘½

I am a service technician that is trying to transition into the cybersecurity field. I grew a profound interest in technology and digital security since I've been a victim of cyber attacks.

# Objective
My self learning path in computer science has led me to develop a passion to become a penetration tester, but for now, I am aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
