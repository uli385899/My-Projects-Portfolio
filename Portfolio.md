# Greetings earthling, Im Uli ðŸ‘½
Pronouns: He/Him

I am a service technician that is trying to transition into the cybersecurity field. I grew a profound interest in technology and digital security since I've been a victim of cyber attacks.

# Objective
My self learning path in computer science has led me to develop a passion to become a penetration tester, but for now, I am aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.

# What I'm currently working on
I'm currently enrolled in the HTB Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (HTB CPTS) path on *Hack The Box Academy*. Learning various attack vectors and bash tools help me create a hacker's mindset which improves my ability to defend against attacks.

It's very simple, a virtualized network monitored with the *Elastic* Cloud SIEM. Here's a dashboard I've created that shows the number of records with its event type and corresponding IP addresses.

## Internet Connection Sharing(ICS) for VPN utilization on unsupported devices
As a competitive *Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege* player on console, I would experience recurring DDoS attacks. Opposing players would use third-party websites to resolve gamertags to IP addresses, such as Octosniffer and XResolver, using that information to *boot* players offline using DDoS panels.

Due to Xbox's lack of first-party VPN support, I encountered an ongoing infrastructure problem. To safeguard myself, I forwarded a VPN service to my gaming console via Ethernet, utilizing Windows built-in Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) feature from my desktop.
